    "# Creating a Bedrock Agent that uses a Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "**Amazon Bedrock Agents** is a fully managed service that enables you to create AI agents that can execute complex, multi-step tasks using foundation models. Agents can understand natural language instructions, break down complex tasks into smaller steps and orchestrate interactions between foundation models, APIs, and knowledge bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases** is a fully managed service that implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance foundation models with your private data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will learn how to create an [Amazon Bedrock Agent](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) (FAQ Agent) that can answer questions about AnyCompany's profile, retail policies, financial performance, annual reports, terms and conditions etc by querying an [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/). \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab has two parts - \n",
    "1. Create an Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base\n",
    "2. Create an Amazon Bedrock Agent that uses the Knowledge Base created earlier\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the workshop, you will learn how to leverage the power of [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/) to enhance the capabilities of your foundation models. You will discover how to ingest data into a knowledge base by configuring an S3 bucket as the source for the files containing data and then utilize the RAG technique to provide more relevant and accurate responses to users. By setting up the entire RAG workflow, from ingestion to retrieval and prompt augmentation, you will gain hands-on experience in leveraging the managed services offered by Amazon Bedrock, without the need to build custom integrations or manage complex data flows.\n",

    "## Create a New Knowledge Base\n",
    "- In the AWS Console go to Amazon Bedrock service\n",
    "- Click on Knowledge bases and click Create. Select the \"Knowledge Base with a Vector store\" option.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/kbWithVecor.png \"KB with Vector store\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can keep the pre-populated value for Knowledge Base name or provide you own\n",
    "- For IAM Permissions, select \"Create and use a new IAM role\"\n",
    "- Choose Amazon S3 as the data source\n",

    "## Configure Data Source\n",
    "1. On the \"Set up data source\" page:\n",
    "   - **Data source name**: Enter a name for your data source or use the default.\n",
    "   - **S3 URI**: The documents needed for the Knowledge Base have been already uploaded into a S3 bucket. Choose the S3 bucket with the prefix \"retail-assistant\". Choose the folder \"anycompany_profile\". The final value should be like ```s3://anycompany-retail-xxxxxx/anycompany_profile/```\n",
    "2. Leave all other settings at their default values\n",
    "3. Click \"Next\"\n",

    "1. Click \"Create knowledge base\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wait for Creation and Sync\n",
    "It will take few minutes to create the knowledge base. \n",
    "Once created, we will ingest the data from S3 into the Knowledge Base.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the AWS console, open the Knowledge Base that was just created\n",
    "1. In the Data source section, select Data source and click on Sync\n",
    "5. Wait for the sync process to complete (status will change to \"Ready\")\n",

    "# Create FAQ Agent with a single Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of the lab you will learn how to create an [Amazon Bedrock Agent](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) (FAQ Agent) that can answer questions about AnyCompany's profile, retail policies, financial performance, annual reports, terms and conditions etc by querying the [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/) that we created in the previous step. \n",

# Strands Agents Fundamentals

This directory contains two Jupyter notebooks that provide a comprehensive introduction to the Strands Agents framework, a simple-to-use, code-first framework for building AI agents with Amazon Bedrock.

## Notebook 1: Strands Agents Foundations - Level 1

The first notebook covers the basic foundations of Strands Agents:

- **Environment Setup**: Installing necessary packages and configuring Amazon Bedrock access
- **Simple Agent Creation**: Creating agents with default and custom model parameters
- **Model Configuration**: Working with different Bedrock models and customizing parameters
- **Debugging and Logging**: Enabling debug logs to understand agent operations
- **Tools Integration**: Using built-in example tools and creating custom tools
- **Observability**: Understanding metrics and how to measure agent performance


## Notebook 2: Strands Agents Foundations - Level 2

The second notebook builds on the foundations and explores more advanced features:

- **Streaming Responses**: Using async iterators for real-time streaming of agent responses
- **Callback Handlers**: Implementing custom handlers to process events during agent execution
- **Advanced Observability**: Working with traces and metrics for detailed insights
- **State Management**: Managing conversation history and agent state
- **Conversation Managers**: Using different conversation managers including SummarizingConversationManager
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Integrating with MCP to extend agent capabilities

These notebooks provide both theoretical knowledge and practical examples to help you understand and start working with Strands Agents for building AI applications with Amazon Bedrock.
